						<p class="lead">
							Two types of users worked together in the Developer Console to fullfill its main objective: The <u>creation</u>
							,  approval, publication and management of each module, which would then be ready for sale in the Module Store.
							<p>
								Module makers would register and manage their modules, while Google Admins would review their information,  and approve or reject each module.
							</p>
							<br> 
							<p class="lead">My job as a UX Designer in the project</p>
							<p>
								As I was not involved in the project from start, my first objective as the UX designer was to generate an expert review to mark pain points and propose solutions to create a more standardized, scalable UX.
								The process of registration, approval, and publication of each module was the most important operation within the DC. The analysis and redesign of that user flow took the most part of my time spent in the project. Its importance could be explained by 3 points:
								<ul>
									<li>Multiple users interact at different stages of the process.</li>
									<li>
										It was a long process with a big load of information to be filled.
									</li>
									<li>
										That information was going to be consumed by the finals users in the Module Store.
									</li>
								</ul>
								Due to the complexity of user tasks and flows, I generated user testings to test my UX assumptions. I worked closely with the visual designer to ensure that our design were material design compliant.
								Finally, as the project was in development and decisions changed rapidly, we kept weekly meetings with the client partner and the client himself to share our progress and understand their requirements.
