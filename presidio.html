      <h4>Previous version</h4>

        <ul class="no_disc">
          <li class="mb96">
            <h4 class="fwb">1. Site navigation was chaotic. Opening a menu may result in seeing a huge list of menu items. Too many options to pick.</h4>
            <p>
              <b>- Solution:</b> Card sorting was used to prioritize choices available and cut them down. A/B testing was performed with the two versions of the menu. In the “B” version. Big lists were only kept in Landing Pages were Presidio could make
              use of imaginery and copy to explain in a more organized way which were visitors options. .
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>- Results:</b>Bounce rate of pages coming from the menu navigation was reduced. More users found what they were looking for. Heatmap also showed an increase in menu navigation use.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="mb96">
              <h4 class="fwb">2. Analytics showed that Home page bounce rate while lowered after first redesign, it remained quite high. Events were relevant for the client but in HP showed a low click rate.</h4>

              <p><b>- Hypothesis:</b> The original layout order doesnt help for conversion. Events is the most urgent kind of information so they need to go first.</p>
              <p><b>- Results:</b> Events attendance convertion rate was increased. Landing page bounce rate decreased probably because users realize quicker that they were new updated content to look at.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="mb96">
              <h4 class="fwb">3. Headlines optimization.</h4>
              <p>
                <b>- Hypothesis:</b> User are going to understand headlines easier and faster if they are written in a simpler language.

                <p><b>- Experiment:</b> Improve mobile layout, simplify it by removing irrelevant elements and make courses easier to buy. Add button to save course as bookmark to check later and a notification badge to remind users when they use their desktop
                  account.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>- Fact:</b> Bounce rate decreased in mobile and sharing events increased. But sales did not show a relevant increase.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>- Conclusion:</b> User survey showed that obvious always win. Simpler title like “Things to do” were prefered over “Experiences”.

                <li class="mb96">
                  <h4 class="fwb">4. Landing page images optimization</h4>
                  <p><b>- Hypothesis:</b> Images with people attract more public than images showing a natural landscape with no one around, specially for events. A National Park can be a happy buzzing place to go. (Kid sells).
                  </p>
                  <p><b>- Results: </b>Click rates increased for events with those kinds of images. Client was advised to take results as a rule and instruct employees to choose images for events showing the park as a buzzy place.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="mb96">
                  <h4 class="fwb">5. How can we increase event attendance and therefore visitors amount?:</h4>
                  <p><b>- Fact:</b> Even though Presidio events are free, they require users to reserve their seats. At first moment, price was included because they were simple no price at all.</p>
                  <p><b>- Hypothesis:</b> Mentioning that events are free increases the click and conversion rate.</p>
                  <p>Suscription boxes different versions: Popups, notification at bottom, sticky dialog.
                  </p>

                <li class="mb96">
                  <h4 class="fwb">6. Analytics showed that Transportation was one of the most visited pages.</h4>
                  <p><b>- Hypothesis:</b> We can use Transportation large number of pageviews to redirect users to other sections of the website.</p>
                  <p><b>- Hypothesis:</b> Mentioning that events are free increases the click and conversion rate.</p>
                  <p>Suscription boxes different versions: Popups, notification at bottom, sticky dialog.
