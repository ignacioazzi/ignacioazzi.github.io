						</header>
						<p class="lead">
							The main objective of the project was to <u>research the gaming market and gamers</u> and discover whether there was a feasible business model where millennials would be encouraged to save and invest by using a product from our client.
						</p>
						<h4>The client</h4>
						<p>The client is a financial and investment company who was looking to research and ideate a business model that would encourage millennials to improve their saving and investment habits through the aid of gaming.
						</p>
						<h4>
							How we addressed the project
						</h4>
						<p>We traveled to New York where we met our client to understand his business model, current situation, objectives, other projects, and why he was pitching to millennials.
							The UX team ideated a series of interviews, conducted by me, to understand millennials needs, objectives, motivations, and savings/gaming habits.
							<br>
							Based on the market and user research, we proceed to gather our finding and participate in an internal ideation where we proposed lots of ideas. Those ideas were organized, categorized, and voted on. Three ideas were presented to the client, and the one picked was then developed into the final product ideation.</p>
							<h4>
								My role in the project
							</h4>
							<p class="">
								I was part of the UX team, working both as a researcher, conducting the user interviews, and as a designer, ideating the final product UX.
