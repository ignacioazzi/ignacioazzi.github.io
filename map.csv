4,Arriving to Malta,11,,,,"When Napoleon's fleet arrived off Malta, Napoleon demanded that the Knights of Malta allow his fleet to enter the port and take on water and supplies.

This was the start of the so-called Battle of the Pyramids, a French victory over an enemy force of about 21,000 Mamluks.The French defeated the Mamluk cavalry with a giant infantry square, with cannons and supplies safely on the inside.
