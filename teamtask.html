			<h3>Project creation</h3>
			<p>
				After finishing the login process, the user will enter the calendar view.
							There he will be prompted to create his first project.
			</p>
			<p>
				Empty states are a great way to guide the user through the first times he performs an action. Referring to the user by his name is an effortless way to make him feel welcomed.
			</p>
			<p>
				User will be asked to name the project and add participants and categories. Even though users are able to invite users and create categories later, asking them at this moment helps them to layout the first steps of their projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				Categories are automatically given a distinctive color, but can be changed later.

			Then, the user will be taken back to the main screen and invited to create his first task and complete the following information:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Task title: As tasks may include different kinds of information and be formed by large sentences, there is no character limitation.
				</li>
				<li>
					Task delivery or due date: This date will be used to organize tasks cards in the Calendar view.
				</li>
				<li>
					Task category: User must choose an existing one or create one at that moment. Categories are used to organized tasks among different group of members.

		<h3>Benchmark analysis</h3>

		<p>
			An important component of measuring user experience of a website is to know how it performs in comparison to its competitors.
							Competitive benchmarking is a research method where you compare a website’s key performance measures with its direct or indirect competitors.
		</p>
		<p>
			The results of competitive benchmark studies help establish best practices, form baseline performance metrics, identify problem areas and build a vision and direction for product strategies for the next product release cycle.

			<p>
				Tasks quick actions can be accessed by doing a long press above any task cards or by clicking in the overflow menu. Users can perform the following actions:
								- Set category: opens popup.

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<p>
				Users can navigate through the different categories by accessing the Navigation Drawer (Hamburger menu). This menu is widely used through main mobile apps like Gmail, Google Play, Google Calendar, Facebook, Twitter, and more.
								Apart from the categories created by the team, two "smart" categories are automatically added: "Tasks created by me", and "Tasks assigned to me." These help users to find relevant tasks for them.

<h3>Introduction and objective of the project</h3>
<p>
	I was in charge of the UX design in this project. The client asked to create a user experience specifically for the mobile consumer, where simplicity and ease-of-use were at the forefront of the design. Unlike other, more complicated collaboration apps, TeamTask’s UX  includes features that focus specifically on connecting and collaborating with peers and employees, revolving around a central calendar function.
</p>
<h3>How it was done</h3>
<p>
	Firstly, a competitor analysis was ran to check how mobile task management apps like Google Calendar, Wunderlist, Trello, and Todoist ran. These apps were chosen because they were the top rated apps in Google Play that offered similar features. The collected information was grouped into categories.
</p>
<p>
	Based on research and the client's brief, I started sketching a mobile app based on the main calendar view, which could offer the main team management features without creating a complex UX with a steep learning curve.
