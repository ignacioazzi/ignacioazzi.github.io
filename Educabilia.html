				<p class="leady strong">To rethink and optimize the UX to increase ROI, conversion rate and attract new users, both teachers and students.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>I worked closely to the CEO and CTO who doubled as PO. The company main revenue source was digital ads and investor funds, so it was crucial to rethink and optimize the UX to increase the ROI, conversion rate and attract new users, both teachers and students.
			</p>
			<h4>Gathering the data</h4>
			<p> We started to gather data from different sources to better understand what and how should we change or optimize:
				<ul>
					<li><b>	Google Analytics:</b> Conversion rate, Bounce rate and exit rate for each of the conversion funnel main pages, courses that convert better, sources where users were coming from.
					</li>
					<li><b>Client feedback:</b> Coming from email communication and surveys.</li>
					<li><b>User comments:</b> Left at the course detail pages and personal comments.</li>
					<li><b>Competitor websites:</b> We checked their business models, the benefits they were offering and where they were failing.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Information was collected in Google Analytics reports and in a spreadsheets shared and updated by the whole team.</p>
			<h4>Data analysis and ideation process</h4>
			<p>We maintained biweekly meetings where we work together by brainstorming ideas. The result of those ideations sessions were a big list of improvements, ideas and opportunities to be considered. Experiments were prioritized and organized based on impact and effort points assigned by a voting system divided in Business, Marketing, Design and Development efforts.</p>

		<!-- 	<h4>Data analysis and ideation process</h4>
			<p>We use the SCRUM framework, splitting our tasks into sprints. We had daily design meetings where we started sketching on a whiteboard for each task. This allowed us to work together, designing a consistent user flow.
			</p>
			<p>
			When we reached a consensus, I moved on to design the wireframes in Illustrator. Once our own set of UI components were created, we usually sketched it out and then jumped directly to the browser.</p>
			<p>
				We used semantic HTML5 for the markup, Sass + Compass for the visual styling, We also based our CSS architecture on concepts from SMACSS.

				<li class="mb96">
					<h4 class="fwb">1. Analytics showed that there was a high number of registered courses  only a couple of them selled really well. What courses sale better and why?</h4>
				<!-- 	<p><b>- Hypothesis 1:</b> Some themes like cousine or programming languages were more interesting for the Educabilia users than others.
			</p> -->
			<p>
				<b>- Hypothesis:</b> Many courses owners were not tech proficient enough to choose an attractive image and title. Some of them also copy paste information they have from other sites and did not bother to format it in a readable way.
			</p><p>
			<b>- Solution:</b> Help new users with low sells by offering them to design imagery to place in our Social Media and theirs detail page for a small fee. <a class="u" href="#social_media">Check the Social Imagery Section</a>.</p> <p>Send email explaining that improving title and description changes can help increasing sales.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="mb96">
			<h4 class="fwb">2. Analytics: High bounce rate in course detail page. Descriptions were long wall of texts and students frequently asked questions about info already present in the description. How can we help users by make their buying decision faster and easier?</h4>

			<p><b>- Problem:</b> Users leave comments asking questions that were already in the description.  User loses time asking questions. Clients have to take time to answer them.</p>
			<p><b>- Hypothesis:</b> Information architecture doesnt help users to make an efficient buying decision.</p>
			<img class="img-center shadow_light mt48 tac" src="img/educabilia/bar.png" alt=""></p>
			<p class="smaller tac">Info bar showing price, type of course, location and more</p>
			<p>
				<b>- Solution:</b> Analyze more asked questions and most relevant information. Design the info bar which answers: where, how much, how, and when.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>- Solution 2:</b> After the first solution, we iterate on this experiment by creating a variation where content appeared divided in tabs.
				<img class="img-center shadow_light mt48 tac" src="img/educabilia/tabs.png" alt="">
				<p class="smaller tac">Content was divided in: Objetives, content, requirements and professor info. Users could add more tabs if neccesary. </p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>- Results:</b> Conversion rate was increased, bounce rate decreased, the time lag was decreased as less users had to wait to have their questions answered. <br>Heatmaps showed that users had no problems using tabs to find the info their were looking for.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="mb96">
			<h4 class="fwb">3. Opportunity: Competitor analysis showed that they did not offer a good mobile experience. At the same time, Analytics showed Facebook mobile was a big source of traffic.</h4>
			<p>
				<b>Hypothesis:</b> Improving mobile layout will help increasing sales.

				<p><b>Experiment:</b> Improve mobile layout, simplify it by removing irrelevant elements and  make courses easier to buy. Add button to save course as bookmark to check later and a notification badge to remind users when they use their desktop account.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Results:</b> Bounce rate decreased in mobile and sharing events increased. But sales did not show a relevant increase.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Conclusion:</b> Even though our experiment failed, we learnt something useful from our users: People use mobile to research, save courses and share them with friends, but prefer to buy using desktop.
					Possibly reasons: </p>
					<p>
						- People do not trust putting credit card info in their mobiles.<br>
						- Payment process outside Educabilia is not optimized for mobile.<br>
						- People prefer to go back to desktop to have more time to read and analyze.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="mb96">
						<h4 class="fwb">4. Checkout conversion rate optimization: What was the problem?</h4>
						<p><b>- Hypothesis 1:</b> Menu bar was a distraction gateway for users. Removing it and letting users focus in relevant info will increase conversion.
						</p>
						<p><b>- Hypothesis 2: </b>Adding contact information in case of problems and Paypal Security icons will increase the confidence of the user in the service.</p>
						<img src="img/educabilia/checkout.png" alt="" class="mb48 shadow_light tac">
						<p class="smaller tac ">Designed to show only the relevant information regarding the course. <br> After pressing "Confirm payment", users got a confirmation message plus an email detailing how to proceed.</p>

						<h4 class="fwb">5. Hero image landing page optimization</h4>

							<div class="col-md-6 "><img src="img/educabilia/studing_together.jpg" alt="">
								<p class="smaller">Image showing people studying as a part of a class</p></div>
								<p><b>- Question:</b> Which kind of images attracts users and converts better? Do users prefer online courses where they can study wherever they want at their own pace, or do they prefer to attent to classes and be part of a group?</p>
								<p><b>- Answer:</b> Images showing "people studying with computers by themselves" had 15% higher conversion rate than “people studying in a class”.</p>
								<p><b>- Conclusion:</b> While Educabilia offered both type of courses, current users preferred online courses, where they could take them wherever they would and at their own pace.
